    <h3>What is DBMS?</h3>
    Database Management System (DBMS) refers to the technology solution used to optimize and 
    manage the storage and retrieval of data from databases. 
    <P>DBMS offers a systematic approach 
        to manage databases via an interface for users as well as workloads accessing the databases via apps.</P> 
    The management responsibilities for DBMS encompass information within the databases, 
    the processes applied to databases (such as access and modification), and the databaseâ€™s 
    logic structure. DBMS also facilitates additional administrative operations such as 
    change management, disaster recovery, compliance, and performance monitoring, among others.
